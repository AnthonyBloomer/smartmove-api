# smartmove API
A RESTful API to retrieve property price statistics in Ireland and the UK. 

This API is being built as part of my final year software project, Smartmove, a data platform that enables businesses and consumers to gain insight into the property market in Ireland and the UK. The project features a Data Warehouse, RESTful API and an in-depth [data analysis using R](https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/smartmove-data-analysis).
